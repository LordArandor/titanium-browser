# titanium-browser
A straightforward and unobtruisive browser doing only what it says on the tin.

Built in Rust, Titanium is designed to remain stable and always on your side. Titanium automatically blocks trackers, cookies, ads, and unnessecary scripts. It doesn't scan your computer, it doesn't even remember where it's been.
