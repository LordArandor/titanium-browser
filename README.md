# titanium-browser
A straightforward and unobtruisive browser doing only what it says on the tin.

Built in Rust, Titanium is designed to remain stable and always on your side. Titanium automatically blocks trackers, cookies, ads, and unnessecary scripts. It doesn't scan your computer, it doesn't even remember where it's been. 

- Author's Note: I'm using this readme as both an introduction to Titanium, and partially a place where I consider what features I want the program to have. Expect everything here to change heavily. 

Titanium uses instances of Trainwreck to run the webpages that you contact. Instaces of Trainwreck are monitored heavily by Titanium, throttling CPU and RAM usage. They can be halted or slowed down at any time to prevent Titanium itself from crashing, which keeps your computer secure and your mind aneurysm-free.

This will take a while, so please do not expect us to have results until we feel that our results are worth showing.
